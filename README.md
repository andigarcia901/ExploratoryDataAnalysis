# ExploratoryDataAnalysis

The data in this project examines 6 different product lines across 3 cities, sales profits, and ratings for the year 2019.  It was interesting to see the similarities between membership and non membership shoppers. The visualizations I created for the data show equality in most categories and a very positive upward linear regression.
